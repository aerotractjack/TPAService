# TPA Calculation API + service
This repo contains the API which exposes the TPA calculation to our network, along with the `systemd` service unit to manage the API.

There is one endpoint, `/tpa`, and documentation can be found at `http://192.168.1.XX:7113/apidocs` (replace `XX` with last two digits of `Sandra`'s IP)
